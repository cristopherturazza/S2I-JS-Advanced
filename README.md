# Best Cities To Live :house_with_garden:
With this simple page, you can search for a city, in a database that includes the best cities in the world, to evaluate its characteristics and choose your next place where you are going to live.

## :question: Why
This project is the final practice for start2impact Javascript Advanced course.<br>
Created in the early 2022, this is my second JS project.

## :bulb: How it works
Start writing the city you are looking for in the main search bar and check the cities available in the suggestions.

Once selected you can start the search and you will see a photo, description and scores of the searched city in a simple nice graph. <br>
If you want to compare the scores with those of another city, you can select one to add to the graph and make your comparison.
